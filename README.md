# CSV File Reader Web Worker

This project demonstrates how to efficiently load and process large CSV files using a Web Worker in JavaScript. A Web Worker allows for offloading heavy computational tasks to a separate thread, preventing the main UI thread from being blocked and improving overall application responsiveness.

## Features

- **Asynchronous Processing**: Utilizes Web Workers to perform file reading and processing asynchronously, ensuring that the UI remains responsive even when dealing with large datasets.
- **Performance Optimization**: By leveraging Web Workers, the application can handle larger files without significant degradation in performance or user experience.
- **Multithreading Support**: Takes advantage of modern browser capabilities to execute tasks in parallel, enhancing the efficiency of data processing operations.

## Advantages

### Performance

- **Non-blocking UI**: The main thread remains free to update the UI, providing a smoother experience for users interacting with the application.
- **Scalability**: Ability to scale up processing power by adding more workers if needed, making it easier to handle increasing loads.

### Multithreading

- **Parallel Execution**: Tasks within a Web Worker run independently of the main thread, allowing for true parallelism where supported by the browser.
- **Resource Management**: Better control over resource allocation and management, as each worker has its own memory space and execution context.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Select a CSV file to upload and start the processing.
